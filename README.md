In this course we’ll use several Python packages that are helpful in solving Machine Learning problems. We’ll be using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn. Pandas is used for reading data and data manipulation, numpy is used for computations of numerical data, matplotlib is used for graphing data, and scikit-learn is used for machine learning models. Each of these packages is quite extensive, but we will review the functions we will be using. We will also review some basic statistics as it is the foundation of machine learning.
